//Exercise 1
let favoriteFood = "chicken";
let favoriteMeal = "breakfast";

console.log("I eat"+" "+favoriteFood+" "+"at every"+" "+favoriteMeal)

//Exercise 4
let c;
let a = 34;
let b = 11;

console.log(a+b) // first expression
// Prediction: it will be 45, because 34 are numbers

console.log(3 + 4 + '5');
//Prediction: it will be 7, because 4 and 3 are number but not 5 , 5 is a string 
//75

//Exercise 5
typeof(15)
/**predictio: it outputs numbers , because 15 is number*/
/** numbers*/
